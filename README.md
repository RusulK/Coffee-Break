Here is a link to the live project. (https://coffeebreak2022.herokuapp.com/)

Coffee Break ! is a website where users come together to share their favourite created Coffee recipes. It is built using the Django Framework in python.

## User Experience (UX)

A visitor to Coffee Break! would be someone who is most likely an adult who is looking to either find new recipes or to share their own creations. 

## User Stories 

A list of my user stories and their tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/RusulK/coffee-break/issues).

### EPIC | Navigation
- As a User I can immediately understand the website's purpose so that I know if it's what I'm looking for.
- As a User I can navigate around the site so that I can easily view desired content.
- As a User I can view a list of recipes so that I can choose one to read.
- As a User I can click on a recipe so that I can read the recipe details.

### EPIC | User's Recipes
- As a User I can create recipes so that other users can view them
- As a User I can view my recipes so that I can see and manage all recipes I have created.
- As a User I can edit recipes so that I can update any changes or mistakes to my recipes.
- As a User I can delete recipes so that I can remove any unwanted recipes I have made.
- As a User I can view all my liked recipes so that I can return to them with ease.

### EPIC | User Interaction
- As a User I can like/unlike recipes so that I can mark which recipes I enjoyed.
- As a User I can comment on recipes so that I can give my feedback to others.
- As a User I can view the number of likes on a recipe so that I can see which is most popular.
- As a User I can view comments on recipes so that I can read other user's feedback.

### EPIC | Sign in
- As a User I can register for an account so that I can begin to use the services afforded to members.
- As a User I can log in/out so that I can like recipes, comment on recipes and manage my recipes.
- As a User I can see my login status so that I know if I'm logged in or out.

### EPIC | Admin
- As an Admin I can view, create, edit and delete all recipes and comments so that I can control the website's content.

### Colour Scheme
- I wanted to keep the colour scheme simple so I stuck with black, white and different shades of brown. This is because the uploaded pictures from users could be any host of colours, so by keeping the colour scheme neutral the site minimises the risk of clashing with any images, keeping them the main focus of the user.

### Typography
- On the site I will be using the default bootstrap fonts as I find them clean, elegant and easy to read so I feel they will fit in with the site's theme nicely.

### Imagery
- All the imagery will be Hot drinks related with only 3 images being static. The rest will be uploaded by various users.
